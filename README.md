# Movies App

This is the code chellenge, that I've got from one of my potential employers.
The application implements next basic features:

* Users can sign in, sign up, update their account and recover password (devise)
* Users can CRUD movies
* Users can upload many images for each movie (carrierwave, aws-sdk, fog-aws)
* Users can see list of their movies

Additionally: 

* Ability to import movie by http://www.omdbapi.com/
